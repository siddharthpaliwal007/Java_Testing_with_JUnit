# Java_Testing_with_JUnit

In Java there are Math libraries containing various trigonometric functions. You will be tasked to write your own trigonometric library for Java. In doing so you will need to implement all the standard functions, SIN, COS, TAN. To calculate these functions consider the Taylor series expansions.

It should be noted that these series are based in radian measure. It would be nice that your library could also generate the function values from degrees. Thus your library will require the appropriate conversion as well to allow the user to chain together functions to produce the desired result. You are not allowed to use any java math library functions when developing your own. If you need a function, then you must create it. As part of your testing make sure that the functions are sound in all 4 quadrants. Will throw a custom exception for invalid usage. The class you will develop will be a static class.
